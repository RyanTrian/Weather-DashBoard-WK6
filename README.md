# Weather-DashBoard-WK6

## TL;DR ðŸ‘€

Challenge 6, server-side APIs, the Weather Dashboard. Utilize **OpenWeather APIs:** current Weather Data, 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast, geocoding API, and weather icons.

## Challenges

- I depended too much on Jquery, this could potentially be a weakness
- Finding the right API and reading the documentations was tought. At first, I thought the UV API is going to work, but later found out that OpenWeather has retired the service. So ended up abandon the UV index feature. However, the code is still there, just commented out.
